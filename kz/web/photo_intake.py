"""Describe seller-uploaded photos without letting them touch the price.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO

The price model was trained on listings that carry photographs, yet the
seller form accepts tabular fields only. That gap is a train/serve skew we
created ourselves, and closing the plumbing is worthwhile even while the
vision work is unfinished.

The price is NOT adjusted here, and no caller may adjust it from these
results. Every supervised photo claim was withdrawn in FINDINGS 28 after the
labelling definition turned out to have drifted, and FINDINGS 23 showed
full-frame CLIP adding nothing over age and price. A condition score shown
to a seller today would be an unvalidated number that most likely just
re-encodes vehicle age.

So this module reports only statements that can be checked by looking at the
picture:

  * how many files were received, and which ones are not readable images;
  * pixel size, and which frames are too small to show damage;
  * exact duplicates by content hash, and near duplicates by perceptual hash
    where imagehash is installed;
  * frames blurrier or darker than almost every listing photo in the corpus;
  * whether the frame shows vehicle bodywork at all.

The last one is the only learned signal used, and it is the only photo axis
this project has validated against its own hand labels: 0.986 ROC-AUC over
117 frames a reviewer marked as cabin, engine bay, wheel, or paperwork. It
answers "is the car body visible", not "is the car damaged".

NOTHING IS WRITTEN TO DISK

Uploads stay in memory for the duration of the request. Keeping seller
photographs would create a personal-data store this project has no policy
for, and turning uploads into training data requires consent that nobody has
given. When that decision is made, add storage deliberately rather than
discovering that the service has been accumulating files all along.

GRACEFUL DEGRADATION

The deployed image installs requirements-web.txt, which carries Pillow but
neither imagehash nor PyTorch: imagehash drags scipy and PyWavelets along for
roughly 80 MB to buy only perceptual near-duplicates, and PyTorch costs two
gigabytes for a single axis, against a 512 MB free-instance ceiling.

Rather than failing, each capability reports itself as unavailable and the
caller shows what it could determine. A service that silently returned fewer
findings would be worse: the public image already fell back to a fixed price
range for weeks without saying so (FINDINGS 35).
