"""Price-estimation logic for the web interface, independent of HTTP.

The split is intentional: these pure functions are callable from tests and
the console, while FastAPI remains a thin adapter in ``app.py``.

One estimate contains:
  estimate        point estimate of a fair advertised price;
  range_low/high  a range with measured coverage: about eight out of ten
                  validation vehicles fall inside it;
  drivers         SHAP contributions explaining the individual prediction;
  position        the seller's price among comparable live listings;
  warnings        the same anomaly signals used to build the review queue,
                  reframed as useful pre-publication checks for honest sellers.
