# KZ Auto Market Intelligence

An end-to-end data and machine-learning system for the Almaty used-car
market: collection, data quality, duplicate-safe validation, price estimation,
market-anomaly review, and experimental visual-condition analysis.

> Enter a car's make, model, year, mileage, engine, transmission, and body
> type. The service returns a fair listing-price estimate, a calibrated range,
> the main factors behind the estimate, and input-quality warnings.

## The project in 30 seconds

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What problem does it solve? | Estimates a fair *listing* price for a used car in Almaty and sends unusually low listings to human review. |
| What is deployed? | A read-only estimator backed by two trained CatBoost models. It does not need the source database for inference. |
| How much data? | 12,799 collected listings; 12,639 rows used by the current model. |
| Main result | **21.16% grouped out-of-fold MAPE**, 13.88% median APE, 22.01% out-of-time MAPE, scoped to working vehicles. |
| Where is the remaining error? | Cars below ₸5M: 28.60% MAPE. Cars at ₸5M+: 16.06% MAPE. |
| Is computer vision in production? | No. Earlier supervised CV results were withdrawn after label-definition drift was found. The live price estimate does not claim to inspect photos. |
| Engineering quality | 281 offline tests plus 6 PostgreSQL integration tests, Ruff, Docker health smoke, and GitHub Actions. |

The free demo can sleep after inactivity. Its first request may therefore take
about a minute; later requests are fast.

## Why this project exists

A marketplace price is not determined only by make, model, and year. Mileage,
engine, transmission, body type, vehicle condition, seller description, and
photos can all matter. Marketplace data is also noisy: the same vehicle may be
relisted, prices can change, and exceptionally cheap ads may be damaged cars,
incomplete listings, bait prices, or genuine bargains.

This project turns that source into an auditable pipeline:

1. collect listing snapshots without overwriting the original evidence;
2. enrich a controlled subset with fields from the full listing page;
3. rebuild a clean analytical table from immutable raw data;
4. group relisted vehicles so copies cannot leak across train and validation;
5. train and compare a general model and a cheap-car specialist;
6. calibrate price intervals and low-price review thresholds on out-of-fold residuals;
7. keep uncertain anomaly and photo decisions in human-review queues;
8. publish only the read-only estimator, never collection or labeling tools.

The system estimates the **first observed listing price**, not the final sale
price. That distinction is part of the model contract and is stored in its
metadata.

## Try the demo

Open the [live estimator](https://kz-auto-market-intelligence.onrender.com/estimate)
and choose **Price estimate**. A realistic example is:

```text
Make: Toyota
Model: Camry
Year: 2019
Mileage: 90,000 km
Engine: 2.5 L petrol
Transmission: automatic
Body: sedan
Condition: used
```

The response contains:

- a point estimate in Kazakhstani tenge;
- a calibrated lower and upper range;
- the model route that answered;
- plain-language factors that moved the estimate;
- warnings for missing or unusual input values.

The same page carries **Check your photos**. Upload the frames you plan to
publish and the service reports unreadable files, duplicates, frames too
small to show panel damage, and — where the image stack is installed —
frames that show no bodywork. It states which checks it could not run.

Photos never change the estimate. The response schema is frozen by test so a
condition score cannot appear without failing it, uploads are held in memory
for the request and never stored, and no validated photo-to-condition model
exists in this project. See [Computer vision status](#computer-vision-status).

The public mode intentionally disables `/label` and `/damage`. Those pages
write human ground truth and must not be exposed to anonymous users. With no
PostgreSQL database, comparable-listing decoration is omitted, but the model
estimate still works.

Check the deployed artifact directly:

```bash
curl -s https://kz-auto-market-intelligence.onrender.com/api/health
```

The response includes the training timestamp, number of training rows, current
validation MAPE, and whether public-demo safeguards are active.

## Current measured results

These numbers come from the model trained on 5 September 2026. They are based
on saved out-of-fold predictions, not predictions on training rows.

**The evaluated population changed with this model.** Listings stating that
the vehicle does not run, and shells missing both engine and gearbox, are now
excluded: their price answers a different question from the one the model is
asked, and they scored 163% MAPE against 21.6% for the corpus. Removing 49
such rows lowered the headline by 0.44 points, but the model itself moved
only 0.02 points with a confidence interval crossing zero. **The figure fell
because the question narrowed, not because the answer improved.** Comparisons
with earlier numbers on this page are therefore comparisons across different
cohorts. Details in [FINDINGS section 37](docs/FINDINGS.md).

Note also what is *not* excluded: 88 listings mentioning a past accident stay
in, because they score 18.7% with almost no bias. A repaired car is an
ordinary car, and dropping those rows would flatter the metric while hiding
nothing.

| Validation view | MAPE | Median APE | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Grouped OOF, routed model | **21.16%** | **13.88%** | Primary model-selection estimate |
| Grouped OOF, general model only | 21.24% | 13.91% | General model before specialist routing |
| Grouped OOF, simple baseline | 29.66% | 14.25% | Median by make + model + year |
| Out-of-time, routed model | **22.01%** | 14.41% | Later listings held out by time |
| Out-of-time, baseline | 31.59% | 14.90% | Same temporal holdout |

Specialist routing changes grouped MAPE by -0.08 percentage points against
the general model, with a paired 95% interval of **-0.23 to +0.07**. The
out-of-time delta is -0.13 points with an interval of **-0.53 to +0.25**.
Both cross zero, so routing remains experimental rather than proven.

Retraining twice on identical data — same fingerprint, same code hash —
produced grouped MAPE within 0.02 points but out-of-time MAPE 0.57 points
apart. Any out-of-time claim smaller than roughly half a point is therefore
not distinguishable from a repeated run.

### Error by price

| Actual listing price | Rows | MAPE | Share of total percentage error |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Below ₸5M | 5,126 | **28.60%** | 55.0% |
| ₸5M and above | 7,464 | **16.05%** | 45.0% |

The 18% overall MAPE target is a research gate, not a promise. If the stronger
segment remains unchanged, the below-₸5M segment must improve to roughly
20.5%. Repeated experiments show that collecting more listing cards alone is
not enough; the missing signal is likely the physical condition of older,
inexpensive cars.

### Error by age

| Vehicle age | Rows | MAPE |
|---|---:|---:|
| 0–5 years | 3,378 | 16.79% |
| 6–10 years | 1,596 | 15.08% |
| 11–20 years | 3,392 | 18.37% |
| 21+ years | 4,224 | **29.43%** |

The sharpest intersection is **21+ years and below ₸5M**: 3,495 rows, 31.19%
MAPE, and 40.8% of all percentage error. The roadmap therefore prioritizes
condition evidence instead of treating every car older than five years as a
single difficult class.

```

The governing rule is: **raw evidence is append-only; conclusions are
recomputed**. If a cleaning or anomaly rule changes, the complete clean layer
is rebuilt from the original observations. This makes corrections
reproducible and prevents past conclusions from mutating their source.

## Modelling logic

### Target and features

The model learns `log(first observed listing price in KZT)`. The logarithm
reduces the dominance of very expensive vehicles and turns many multiplicative
price relationships into easier additive relationships. Predictions are
transformed back to tenge for the user.

A deterministic `price_basis` classifier first checks what that displayed
number means. It links an amount to nearby customs, credit, or down-payment
wording; a credit keyword elsewhere in the description is not enough. A narrow
`parts_price` rule also requires explicit evidence that both engine and gearbox
are absent. Known uncleared-cash, credit-price, down-payment, and parts-vehicle
targets are excluded from model training, while `ambiguous` rows stay in the
data so missing enrichment does not silently erase most of the market.

The deployed models use 13 features:

- numeric: vehicle age, mileage, engine volume, and photo count;
- flags: mileage missing, VIP listing, and monthly-price display;
- categorical: make, model, engine type, transmission, body type, condition.

Marketplace-provided average price and listing category are excluded because
they leak target-derived information. Description, options, and image features
are excluded until their coverage and train/serve consistency are sufficient.

### Duplicate-safe validation

A vehicle can be deleted and relisted under a new ad ID. A random split could
put one copy in training and another in validation, letting the model remember
the answer. The project detects relist groups without using price in the group
key and keeps every complete group in one fold.

The primary metric is grouped out-of-fold MAPE:

```text
APE_i = |actual_i - prediction_i| / actual_i
MAPE  = mean(APE_i) × 100%
```

Median APE is reported because MAPE is pulled upward by a small tail of large
relative errors. Out-of-time validation then asks a separate question: how the
model behaves on listings that appeared later.

### Routed inference and calibrated ranges

The general model predicts every row first. If its prediction is below ₸5M,
the request is routed to a specialist trained on the wider actual-price band
below ₸8M. Routing uses only information available at inference time; using
the unknown actual price would be target leakage.

The price range and suspiciously-low threshold are calibrated on held-out OOF
residuals. The anomaly layer creates a review queue; it does not declare that a
seller is fraudulent. A visibly damaged car at an honest low price is a
legitimate listing, not fraud.

Manual anomaly review lives at `/label`. Its `controls only` mode restricts
both the visible cards and keyboard navigation, so a shortcut cannot silently
label a hidden residual or rule candidate. The progress counter describes the
currently visible subset; the separate journal total is the durable count
across rebuilt queues. One-click `Queue`, `Fraud`, `Legit`, `Unknown`, and
`All` tabs reopen saved decisions and their comments even after the disposable
candidate queue has been rebuilt.

The 5 September evidence audit assigned a review state to all 498 durable
journal rows: 378 `legit`, 2 `fraud`, and 118 `unknown`, with no untouched
rows. `unknown` is an intentional result when the local snapshot has no seller
text, condition badge, or image; it is not silently converted to a negative.
The two confirmed fraud rows form one exact-photo pair posted hours apart with
the same price, mileage, and description under incompatible UAZ models. These
two positives are far too few for a stable production fraud metric.

The local `/price-review` page is a separate, deliberately blinded diagnostic
for the below-₸5M segment. Its first pilot is fixed at 50 listings: 30 old
vehicles with large grouped-OOF errors, 10 random inexpensive controls, and 10
random audit listings selected before error ranking. This audit is random
within the already-downloaded-photo pool, not yet representative of every
cheap listing. Each card requires at least three already-downloaded viewpoints
and asks for three independent facts: overall vehicle
state, what the advertised amount means, and whether the evidence came from
text, photos, both, or neither. OOF predictions are not sent to the browser, so
they cannot anchor the annotator. These labels do not enter price training
directly; they first identify which scalable text or CV feature is worth
building. The current frame can be opened in the precise bounding-box tool
without leaving the listing workflow conceptually.

The fixed 50-listing pilot is now complete: 20 normal, 16 cosmetic,
9 repair-needed, 3 parts, 1 non-running, and 1 unclear. The joined OOF analysis
shows 14.32% MAPE across the two random-source subsets but 104.87% in the 30
cases selected for high error. The strongest clean target defect is the three
parts-price vehicles: mean APE is 457% because the model was asked to compare
incomplete shells with complete cars. A strict corpus rule now excludes five
listings that explicitly lack both engine and gearbox; four had previously
been training-eligible. The 50-row cohort is stored as an immutable local
manifest so a later retrain cannot silently replace reviewed cases.

## Computer vision status

Computer vision is **experimental and not deployed**. The repository contains
image download, perceptual-duplicate grouping, CLIP features, tiled crops,
bounding-box labeling, COCO export, grouped CV, and ROC-AUC/PR-AUC evaluation.
However, a label-definition audit found that the historical `damaged` class
mixed impact/dent damage with rust, scratches, dirt, and paint defects.

All 47 legacy `damaged` frames were first placed in `needs_review` without
deleting or automatically relabeling user work. A later frame-by-frame audit
reviewed the entire 784-frame journal under the corrected policy. It now
contains 18 boxed `damaged` frames from 16 listings, 6 `wreck` frames from
2 listings, 9 `parts`, 615 `intact`, and 136 `unclear`; no row remains pending.
There are only 18 independent damaged/wreck listings, still far below the
roughly 200 positives targeted for a stable local evaluation. Earlier
supervised CV metrics therefore remain withdrawn. This does not affect the
price model because CV never passed its gate or entered price inference.

### What sellers can do with photos today

The estimate form accepts uploads at **Check your photos**
(`POST /api/photos/check`). It exists to close a train/serve gap we created
ourselves: the model was trained on listings that carry photographs while the
form accepted tabular fields only.

It reports only what a person can verify by looking at the picture — files
that are not readable images, duplicates, frames too small to show panel
damage, and frames that show no bodywork at all. The bodywork axis is the
single photo signal validated against this project's own labels, at 0.986
ROC-AUC over 117 frames a reviewer marked as cabin, engine bay, wheel, or
paperwork. It answers "is the car body visible", never "is the car damaged".

**Uploads cannot change the price, and the code cannot express a change.**
The response schema is frozen by a test, so a field such as
`condition_score` cannot appear without that test failing and someone having
to justify it against the gate below. A word blacklist was rejected as the
guard: it trips on the field that states the prohibition and misses a field
that scores condition.

Uploaded files live in memory for the request and are never written to disk,
which is also enforced by test rather than by comment. Storing seller
photographs would create a personal-data store this project has no policy
for, and using uploads as training data would need consent nobody has given.

Where a dependency is absent the service names the check it could not run.
The deployed image installs Pillow but not `imagehash` — the latter pulls
scipy and PyWavelets, roughly 80 MB against a 512 MB ceiling, to buy only
perceptual near-duplicates — so exact duplicates are still detected by
content hash and the response says perceptual matching was unavailable.

The next valid CV milestone is:

1. expand from 18 to roughly 200 independent damaged/wreck listings;
2. pretrain a detector on a licensed external damage dataset without publishing it;
3. fine-tune on local boxes and collect 150–200 independent positive ads, not merely frames;
4. preserve a random audit split before active-learning ranking;
5. test text-derived repair evidence separately from photo-derived evidence;
6. group by ad and exact-photo duplicate components;
7. beat the age+price baseline with a positive lower bound for paired bootstrap delta AUC;
8. only then test whether an automated condition score improves price MAPE.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etozhegatito/kz-auto-market-intelligence.git
cd kz-auto-market-intelligence
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # choose your own PostgreSQL password
docker compose up -d          # applies the schema automatically
python -m pytest tests/ -q
ruff check kz/ tests/ airflow/
python -m kz.web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The local app contains the estimator plus the
protected `/label`, `/price-review`, and `/damage` workflows. The public
deployment exposes only estimation.

The usual workflow is:

```bash
python -m kz.ops.run_all --collect   # the only coordinated network path
python -m kz.ops.run_all --ml        # deterministic offline rebuild and train
python -m kz.ops.pipeline_status     # freshness, backlogs, last-run status
```

Collection uses a shared rolling 24-hour request budget, pacing, a 429 circuit
breaker, atomic reservation, and an HTML-schema health gate. Polite pacing
does not replace permission. Do not use VPNs, proxies, mobile tethering, or IP
rotation to bypass access restrictions.

## Run the public container

Only trained artifacts required for inference are included. Raw listings and
photos are not.

```bash
docker build -t kz-auto-market-intelligence .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e KZ_PUBLIC_DEMO=1 \
  kz-auto-market-intelligence
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
```

The image runs as a non-root user and one Uvicorn worker so it remains within
the 512 MB free-instance limit. `render.yaml` defines the free service and its
model-loading health check.

## Reproducibility and safety

- Dependency versions and Python 3.13 are pinned.
- Each model records its data fingerprint, code hash, Git commit, training
  size, metrics, and target policy.
- Raw ads are append-only; derived tables are rebuilt.
- Tests refuse to use a database whose name does not contain `test`.
- CI runs offline tests, PostgreSQL tests, Ruff, coverage, and a real Docker
  model-load health smoke.
- Public mode disables every endpoint that can mutate human labels.
- No phone numbers are collected, and the VIN itself is never stored.
- Raw listings, descriptions, photos, labels, credentials, reports, and the
  private textbook are not published.

The `.cbm` files contain trained tree weights. They are derivative inference
artifacts, not a browsable copy of the source listings.

## What the project does not claim

- It does not predict the final transaction price.
- It does not diagnose a vehicle's mechanical condition.
- It does not automatically accuse a seller of fraud.
- It does not currently use seller text or uploaded photos in the live price answer.
- It does not guarantee that a vehicle will sell inside the predicted range.
- It does not claim that the 18% MAPE target has been reached.
